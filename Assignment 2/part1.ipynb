Use hierarchical clustering to determine the ordering (see `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` and `dendrogram`), or (if you want to explore alternative visualization techniques) explore some other sorting algorithm. An unsorted heatmap with arbitrary row/column order is much harder to interpret — clusters appear scattered rather than as visible blocks along the diagonal. Use the same ordering for both heatmaps to enable direct comparison.\n",

Senators with similar follows but different posts might follow the same accounts but experience very different information environments based on posting frequency."
