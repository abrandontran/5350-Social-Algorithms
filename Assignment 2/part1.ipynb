Use hierarchical clustering to determine the ordering (see `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` and `dendrogram`), or (if you want to explore alternative visualization techniques) explore some other sorting algorithm. An unsorted heatmap with arbitrary row/column order is much harder to interpret — clusters appear scattered rather than as visible blocks along the diagonal. Use the same ordering for both heatmaps to enable direct comparison.\n",
    "3. **Compare and contrast the two matrices**: What do they show? Interpret any clustering patterns you see. Where do the two matrices differ? Senators with similar follows but different posts might follow the same accounts but experience very different information environments based on posting frequency.\n",

    "**Suggested questions to consider** (you don’t need to answer all or any of these, but they may guide your interpretation): Do senators from the same state follow similar accounts? Do female senators follow systematically different accounts than male senators? Are there identifiable “information bubbles”? How does weighting by post volume change the similarity structure?"
